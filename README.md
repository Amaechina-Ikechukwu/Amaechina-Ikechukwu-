My repo say I am Amaechina Ikechukwu, I go as Ikay for short.. 
I am skilled in the basic trio of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The MERN stack is the stack I have chosen although the projects I've worked on so far involves FER Stack (Firebase,React, Express).
My plan,in a single sentence, is to push my developer career to a more professional outlook especially working with other people.
